Private Burke left with the 19th Battalion, 5th Brigade, and landed at Gallipoli on August 19. He lasted till September 3, when he was wounded in the neck by shrapnel, or as he says the boys call it \"Charley Chaplin.\" The piece of shrapnel went right through his neck, just grazing the vertebrae, and he has had a headache ever since. It is also thought that some of the sinews are injured, and he has yet to undergo an examination under the X rays. \"After being wounded\" (he says) I was put on board a hospital ship and conveyed to England, when I was placed in a hospital at Hampstead. When able to get about I saw a great deal of London. There I Met Buzzy Murray in the Street, quite by accident. He has lost an eye. On the way out to Australia our ship called at the port of Daka, on the African coast, and just after we left a couple of ships were sunk by the German raider Moewe. We were told that we had had a narrow escape. As regards the fighting on the Peninsula, it was lovely, and the boys enjoyed it. We occupied the Turkish trenches which were taken by the 18th Battalion. This battalion was badly cut up. It is a hard life as far as food is concerned. Just a couple of biscuits and a tin of jam. Lieutenant Eric Atkinson, a Parramatta boy, was with us. He was wounded in the leg. He thought he was done for, so he sent for all his platoon and wished them good-bye. At Gallipoli we were safer in the trenches than out of them. We Australians were treated splendidly in England. We could not have been treated better. The English people could not do too much for us, and the Australians resident in England provided us with a buffet where we could at any time get refreshments free. Motor-cars were at our disposal five days a week. Yet some wrote home and said they had to sleep on the banks of the Thames. Well, that was drink.

Private Ernest Edward Freeman and Trooper William Frederick Freeman are still fighting. Another, the only remaining brother, enllsted also; but was discharged medically unfit.\rPrivate Freeman, reported died of wounds, was actually knocked on the head with a sentry's rifle. He was the eldest son of a family of five brothers, four of whom have fought, and one offered and was rejected. 'Herb', as he was generally called, was a fine, thick-set lump of manhood, and was of a particularly determined and unfearing disposition... When war broke out he was in Lismore, and afterwards went to Queensland. From there he went to England, where he was rejected when he volunteered to go to the war. He afterwards found his way to Vancouver, and was engaged for some time in the taking of mules to Egypt and England for war purposes. Whilst thus engaged he contracted malaria, and was in hospital for six months, when he was discharged. The fever affected his hearing somewhat. Returning to his home at Parramatta, he was back but a week when he offered to enlist and was accepted. He went into camp on January 17, 1916, at Liverpool, thence to Melbourne and England. Not long afterwards he was sent to the. firing- line; and on November 9, 1917, the Rev. Hilhouse Taylor visited his relatives and conveyed the tidings that he had been taken prisoner of war. From the Red Cross Mrs. Weeden got the sad news that her brother had died from wounds, whilst a prisoner of war, at Limberg, Germany, according to the German official list, 3/5/17. No date of death was given... He was buried in cemetery of Maubeuge, and the number of his grave is 3' ...The last letter received from him was dated July 1, 1917, and interspersed with family business were the following passages: \u00d1 'Nothing to worry about, only when the war is going to end. I only hope it will be over soon. It is not too bad over here now \u00d1 the hot weather has started. It was too cold.' It was a very brief letter. \rHow He Was Taken. The following statement, supplied to the  Red Cross by a, Private P. Cook, No. 1883, in No. 5 General Hospital, Rouen, under date May 7, 1917, throws a little, light upon the probable cause of Private Freeman's capture;  'I knew Freeman very well. We used to call him 'Darkie.' He was fetching rations at Beaumetz on March 27 last. They had brought the rations up to the trench and went back for water. He said he knew a short cut, and, being a very determined sort of fellow, he went off on his own, against the advice of the other men of the party. Not long afterwards we heard them throwing bombs from the German trench, and we came to the conclusion that he must have lost his way and walked straight into their line. There was not any shelling going on at the time, and we were not making any raid on the German trenches. He was a very game man and a great loss, and much liked in the battalion. He came out from Australia with me in the same boat from Port Lincoln. \"", "died_in_service": "yes", "pds_page_no": "43", "unit_served": "57 Infantry Battalion", "surname": "Freeman", "district": "Parramatta", "service_no": "1897", "contributor": "PA"}}, {"model": "soldiers.soldier", "pk": 133, "fields": {"rank": "Private", "name": "A.", "unique_id": 133, "date_of_embarkation": null, "desc": "", "died_in_service": "", "pds_page_no": "43", "unit_served": "", "surname": "Freeman", "district": "Parramatta", "service_no": "", "contributor": ""}}, {"model": "soldiers.soldier", "pk": 134, "fields": {"rank": "Private", "name": "Ernest Edward", "unique_id": 134, "date_of_embarkation": null, "desc": "", "died_in_service": "", "pds_page_no": "43", "unit_served": "", "surname": "Freeman", "district": "Parramatta", "service_no": "", "contributor": ""}}, {"model": "soldiers.soldier", "pk": 135, "fields": {"rank": "Corporal", "name": "W.", "unique_id": 135, "date_of_embarkation": null, "desc": "", "died_in_service": "", "pds_page_no": "43", "unit_served": "", "surname": "Freeman", "district": "Parramatta", "service_no": "", "contributor": ""}}, {"model": "soldiers.soldier", "pk": 136, "fields": {"rank": "Trooper", "name": "William Fredrick", "unique_id": 136, "date_of_embarkation": null, "desc": "", "died_in_service": "", "pds_page_no": "43", "unit_served": "", "surname": "Freeman", "district": "Parramatta", "service_no": "", "contributor": ""}}, {"model": "soldiers.soldier", "pk": 137, "fields": {"rank": "Private", "name": "A.", "unique_id": 137, "date_of_embarkation": null, "desc": "", "died_in_service": "", "pds_page_no": "43", "unit_served": "", "surname": "Fuller", "district": "Parramatta", "service_no": "", "contributor": ""}}, {"model": "soldiers.soldier", "pk": 138, "fields": {"rank": "Private", "name": "F.

However the news did not come to Mr. and Mrs. Hosford officially.They received advice from the military authorities their son had been reported wounded, not killed, but that the wound was not stated as being serious.  Corporal Bob McKenzie, who was a great mate of Corporal Hosford sent a cable indicating that Frank had been killed. It  was possible that McKenzie saw Frank being taken away by stretcher bearers and took it for granted that he was dead. News quickly followed from Mrs. Hosford that there was no truth that Frank was killed. This time he returned to Parramatta with a \"badly injured left elbow and hand and a war scarred face. He was in hospital at Bristol for some months, and returned incapacitated.\" He joined his brother Dick who had lost a leg and eye in the war.

The following letter reached 'The Argus' on Thursday: \u00d1 'Dear Sir, \u00d1 I am sending you a few lines, and would like you to publish them in the old paper. I left Parramatta three years ago, with the Cooees, and I am sorry to say there are only two or three of us left to tell the tale. I was taken prisoner in that big stunt last March and April. One of my mates that I enlisted with was killed alongside me, just before we started to advance towards the Germans. His name is Webber. Most of the boys will know him. For the first five days I was captured I had nothing to eat. All they would give us was a drop of water to drink. We were taken further back behind the lines, and there we were counted out into working parties, about 300 in a party, then again sent up behind the German lines, on munition dumps, and different kinds of work. There we stayed until our people started to make the big advance, and we were gradually moved back to Germany. But never the whole journey did we have a lift in a train or motor lorry. We had to foot it the whole way, right across Belgium, 20 and 30 miles a day, and hardly anything to eat. In passing through the Belgium towns the Belgians would do their best to help us. They would give us bread and comforts, but the Germans would take all that off us and knock us down with their rifles. But we were never downhearted \u00d1 we would scramble to our foot again and still have another go at it. It was either that or starvation. We were mostly living on potato peelings, turnip peeling's, and cabbage leaves, and it was An Awful Sight to see us having our dinner. The poor lads were dying every day, and yet they would not give us any care. When we wanted a smoke we had to pick up the ends of cigarettes and cigars which the Germans had dropped, and not every one of us could get that much. You can't imagine how happy we e to-day, now that we are released. We were released about two weeks ago. They just cast us adrift and told us to find our way back. They never gave us any bread to start with, not even a bite. Only for the Belgians we should have had hundreds of deaths along the road. But the Belgians cared for us in every manner possible. My mate and I were taken in by a Belgian lady, and there we stayed for five days, living on the best. When we were leaving they packed our bags with sandwiches and cakes, also plenty of cigarettes and money. We crossed the British lines on the 17th Nov - and we were heartily greeted by our own lads. Several of us had to go to hospital through sickness. I am in hospital at present, but will be across to England for Christnias, and have to be home in Parramatta shortly afterwards. Think I will close for the  present, as it is getting beyond my time for sitting up. \u00d1 I remain, your soldier friend, , No. 4861, Pte C. R. McMillan '45th Batt.'

Mr. Nobbs stated that he had presented the watch to the soldier in the presence of a well known and highly respected citizen in all good faith. He would prosecute this matter right up to the hilt and, if any imposition had been inflicted on the wristlet watch committee steps would be taken to have the watch returned forthwith. Messrs. F. Bowdon and J. S. Townsend (secretary) said the watch had apparently been secured under false pretences, which was a degrading thing to do, and the watch should be returned. Mr.Bowden: \"\"I hope there are no repetitions of this kind, the watches were costly, and this sort of thing was very discouraging. The watch fund was considerably in debt, and they had no time for imposters.\"\" It was eventually decided, on the motion of Mr. F.

When he was young, his mother died and he was then adopted by his neighbours Mr Benjamin George and Mrs Rachel Potter in Woy Woy, NSW. Working as a carpenter, when he heard his adopted brother Walter Arthur Potter (service no. 4578) enlisted, Lukeen also followed and enlisted in Holsworthy on 16 August 1915 at 32 years old. His next of kin was listed as Mabel Letitia Potter (friend), of 'Benray', Good Street, Granville. Both boys embarked from Sydney on 16 February 1916 aboard HMAT Ballarat A70.\r\rBy 12 August 1916, the Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers Advocate (p.4) reported Private Lukeen was missing in action in France on 19 or 20 July 1916.\rPRIVATE G. M. LUKEEN.\rMr. and Mrs. Potter, of Good-street, Granville, who received the sad intelligence of the death in action of their son, Private Walter Potter, on Monday night, received a second shock on Tuesday in a telegram from Victoria Barracks, announcing that their adopted son, Private G. M. Lukeen, was reported missing on the same date given them of their son's death, viz., July 19 or 20. When in his early youth Private Lukeen's mother died and left him an orphan at Woy Woy, Mr. and Mrs. Potter took him into their home, as he and their son, Private Potter had throughout their boyhood been great chums. Private Lukeen was a laborer and fisherman, and was very well and popularly known all over the Hawkesbury. When he received word that his adopted brother was going to the war, he at once came to Sydney and enlisted with him, and they left together, attached to the same regiment, as brothers-in-arms. Private Lukeen was 32 years of age. The captain of the regiment to which they were attached has been reported as killed in France, so it is quite likely that is where Private Potter has been killed and Private Lukeen missing. (CAFA 12/08/1916 p.4)\r\rBy 23 January 1917 it was confirmed that Private Lukeen was indeed 'captured on 20/7/16 at Levantie' and was now a prisoner of war in Germany.

He was a single carpenter. Son of Mr Benjamin George and Mrs Rachel Potter, 'Benray,' Good Street, Granville and adopted brother of George Mathew Lukeen (sevice no 4537).

Potter, of 'Benray,' Good-street, Granville, killed in action July 19 or 20, 1916, supposedly in recent fighting with the Turks on Sinai Peninsula. Private Walter Arthur Potter was 32 years' of age. His father was formerly stationmaster at Woy Woy, and more recently at Harris Park, which position he resigned on account of ill-health. The deceased soldier enlisted in August, 1915, and went into camp at Liverpool, being attached to the 14th Reinforcements, 13th Battalion, 4th Brigade. He was in camp with his adopted brother, Private George Lukeen (who also sailed with him) when the big riot broke out at Liverpool Camp, and because they would not join in with the rioters they were both threatened that they would be \"done for.\" They were to have sailed that day, but it was not till two days afteryards that the contingent was taken quietly to the transport and sent silently and quietly away to do their bit to uphold the flag which still protects those rioting rotters. In subsequent letters both expressed their keen grief at having to leave without the usual parade and public farewell demonstrations. Private Potter duly arrived in Egypt, and was there transferred to the 54th Battalion, 14th Brigade. After a stay of 10 days in Cairo, his battalion was ordered to the desert, whence he wrote his letter home on June 10. Rev. A. E. J. Ross conveyed the sad and suddenly tragic news of his death in action to his parents on Monday night, per medium of a telegram received from Colonel Luscombe at Victoria Barracks, Sydney. No particulars were given, so it is presumed that Private Potter met his death in the recent lighting against the Turks on the Sinai Peninsula. The date of death was given as \" between the 19th and 20th July.\"  No news has been received recently of Private Lukeen. The late Private Potter, though a carpenter (he having worked on numerous buildings in this and other suburbs) was never a robust man, and friends of the family have repeatedly expressed their surprise at his success in passing the tests. Early in life he fractured his right arm, and the bone was never straight afterwards, with the result that he always carried the limb in almost the same position as it is shown in the photo, resting on the chair. After entering camp he contracted laryngitis, and was for three months under specialists. Soon after his recovery he was sent away. He is described by his acquaintances as having been a most upright man, a very straight goer, and a genial and popular companion.

We feel the loss of our mates greatly, as we have been together just on twelve months now. Bert and Harry Horton were very jovial and full of fun and life amongst us, and in and out of the trenches we miss them very much.

He was the son of Eduard Samuel Beale, a \u00d2master of law at Newington College\u00d3 prior to his death and Margaret (nee Trevillion).[1] At the time of his enlistment in Liverpool on 18 May 1915, he was a 29 years old labourer staying with his uncle and aunt, William J. and Evangeline Coulson (nee Trevillion), of \"Ardrossan\", North Parade, Auburn, New South Wales. His widowed mother was living on Olinda Street, Quarry Hills, Bendigo, Victoria. His first cousin, Miss Coulson, was a well-known war worker. On 28 July 1915 he left with the original 17th Battalion aboard HMAT A23 Suffolk from Sydney for the front. He went through the Gallipoli campaign from 15 June to the withdrawal in the latter part of December. He afterwards went to France and took part in all the big engagements there, going through without a scratch. In April 1918, however, he was severely wounded in the head and suffered \u00d2shell face\u00d3 and excision of his left eye.[1] After 4 months of being in hospital, where he was progressing favourably in England, he was officially returned to Australia on 24 August 1918 per \u00d2D21\u00d3. For his service, he was awarded the 1914-15 Star Medal, British War Medal, and Victory Medal.[2] In mid-1920 he married Australian Red Cross Worker Gladys Muriel Bennett in Marrickville, NSW. During the Great Depression, Cecil returned to his original trade as a labourer despite having lost his left eye and the couple lived in Gladesville, then Balgowlah, before settling in Manly where Cecil worked for a time as a mill hand. When the Second World War broke out, he re-enlisted and worked as part of the 21 Australian Labour Company (service number N274927) [3] and was a soldier for the next 20 years before retiring in North Curl Curl where his daughter lived.[4] At 79 years old, he passed away on 6 October 1964 at his daughter\u00d5s home in North Curl Curl. He was survived by his wife, 3 daughters \u00d0 Alice Heaton, Gladys Tolland, Ethel Klause, son Ernest and their families.[5]\r\rReferences\r[1] Private Ernest Beale. (1918, July 20).

In London he came across Wally Bray, son of the late Tom Bray, of Parramatta, and brother of Mrs. George Robilliard. Buller is now 25 years of age. Ho was educated at Parramatta South school. Owing to enlisting in the English Army, he is not in receipt of any pension. He says he will soon be fit to work again, and has a first class English Army certificate as a mechanic driver. He was publicly welcomed home at the Auburn Town Hall on Monday by Mayor Cheetham and a large number of the residents. (CA 28/07/1917 p.4)\r\rTHE PIRATES.

His father took part in the expedition to Rabaul, and on his return home he desired to join the A.I.F. for service abroad, but for some physical disability he was turned down. Not to be beaten he volunteered for service in England at munition making and was accepted, but he was determined to be a fighter if it was at all possible to get to the front, and it was his intention to try and enlist in the old country. Whether he succeeded in carrying his wish into effect is not known by Mrs. Divorty, and, in view of the shortage of men he may at the present moment be in the firing line.

Whilst in company with the remainder of the staff we  were cheering the news of a glorious victory, in France, a bullet struck him in the neck and penetrated the lung. He received every attention it was possible to give, but nothing could save his life, and he died in about a quarter of an hour. He died very peacefully, and free from pain. His last words were, 'I am going to die; say good-bye to mother.' Corporal Aubrey is buried in the brigade cemetery, and his comrades are erecting a stone to mark his grave, which is well fenced in and protected. A voluntary parade was held for his funeral, and practically the whole brigade turned out to pay their respects to their comrade. I may say that I feel his loss keenly, as Corporal Aubrey was my clerk for a long period, and I know I shall never be able to replace him. Please accept my condolence and those of the commanding officers, officers and men of the brigade, who one and all are grieving with you today over your loss.' Lieutenant-Colonel S E Christian, O.C. 1st 'F.A.B. in a letter of condolence says : \u00d1'He was respected and loved by all his comrades, and we all deplore his loss.'

Twelve hours solid going dressing wounds and getting nice dishes for anyone who is too sick to eat the regular fare (which is first-rate), taking temperatures and pulses, they have plenty to do. You should see how the Red Cross Society works here. They meet the men at the boats and give them all sort of comforts, and they have fitted the trains travelling between Alexandria and Cairo with refreshment cars, so you see they look after us.  I can tell you it is a bit lively on the boat from the base to Alexandria, men groaning and moaning all right, some with shattered legs, others with bullets through their bodies, and some with bullets lodged in their joints. Poor wretches, they do suffer some of them and there are others who joke about it the day after getting their limbs taken off.\r\rDespite the seriousness of his wounds he rejoined his battalion in January 1916.

THE GUILDFORD HERO.\rThis was the question asked by the five years-old orphan son of a brave soldier. Private Samuel Jude, of Old Guildford, when his grandmother told him last week that his father had died in England as the result of wounds received In France, Private Jude was as fine as man in the flesh as he looks in the picture, he was 28 years of age, and before the war broke out had been working for about six years along the plpe-line at Guildford, and was a very popular man with his work-mates and all with whom he came into contact. He was an Englishman and was married about six yours ago, by Rev. A. E. J. Ross, in Christ Church, Old Guildford, to Miss Adeitha Hare, daughter or Mr. and Mrs. J. G. Hare, of Orchardlelgh-road, Old Guildford. They resided for some time at Bolton-street, Granville, where Mrs. Juile died when her first child (the one who asked the above significant question) was but five days old. The bereaved hus band then took his child to the latter's grandmother's home, where they resided until September of last year, when the father enlisted. He sailed on November 2 with the 5th Reinforcements of the I8th Battalion, 5th Brigade, for Egypt and was very soon afterwards transferred to France. He was there wounded, on May 11, whilst carrying out some heroic mis sion for which his superior officer called for volunteers, and he was one of the braves who answered that call. He received a gun-shot wound in the face, and was taken to the Brook War Hospital at Woolwich, England, where he arrived on May 30. Ever since that time various messages have come through as to his con dition be being reported sometimes as pro gressing favorably, at others as seriously, and still at others as criticallyill. But at last the poor, brave fellow, whose wounds must have been of an awful nature, sur rendered to the Great God of Battles, and Mrs. Hare received a message from Vic toria Barracks stating that Private Jude had succumbed to his wounds on July 20. A cable message, dated, August 1, however, stated that death had occurred on July 20. The unfortunate hero could not, of course, write during all this time, but a few par ticulars of his wounds wore received by Mrs. Hare in a letter written by Private Jude's sister in England, and dated June 25. This stated that they had been to see him in hospital and that the hero would not be able to write for some time. \"He is getting up a little in the day-time now. One of his poor eyes is very bad. They are trying hard to get it well but are afraid they will have to take it out. He can now begin to feed himself. He has no roof to his mouth. He has got to have an artificial one put in, also an artificial jaw. He will be a patched-up poor boy. He says he would, not mind getting back home.\" The now dead soldier sent New Year's greetings, to his little son when in Egypt on a post-card taken with some mates at the Pyramids.

James Murdoch Archer Durrant served at Anzac, Egypt, France, and Flanders. Rising from the rank of captain to that of Lieutenant-Colonel and winning the Distinguished Service Order and the C.M.G. He served with conspicuous bravery at Gallipoli with the 13th Battalion, and in recognition of this service \u00d4Durrant's Post\u00d5 at Gallipoli was named after him.\r\rWhen war broke out Durrant was a 29 year South Australian whose career as a soldier had led him from his birthplace in Gleng to his appointment as Captain-Adjunct at the Parramatta Barracks. Born in 1885 he had been educated at Goodwood Public School, and the old Agricultural School, in Adelaide. From 1899 to 1903 he served as a bugler in the Adelaide Rifles, and four years in the No. 1 S.A. Battery of A.F.A., in which he finished as a sergeant. In 1908 he successfully passed his examination for Staff Sergeant-Major and was appointed to the New South Wales 'A & I' staff at Parramatta. He was promoted to Lieutenant in July 1910. His career then took another turn as he was transferred to Queensland where he was promoted to Captain, and then to military headquarters in Melbourne, Victoria.\rHowever throughout all these moves, and indeed for the rest of his life, his ties Parramatta remained strong, for while he was stationed at the Barracks he met and married a local girl, Miss Birk, whose mother lived in Westmead .\r\rSoon after war was declared he signed up for active service but initially this was declined as his administration skills acquired over seven years at the Barracks were deemed more important by the Military. Finally in October, 1914, he was sent to New South Wales to be adjutant to the 13th Battalion, Australian Infantry Force.\r\rBut while Durrant was a born leader and organiser, he was also, as would soon be proved, courageous under fire. on 19 December 1914 he was released from administration duties and leaving with the New South Wales Battalion under Lieutenant-Colonel Burridge and so it was he was stationed in Egypt when he was called upon to be part of the first wave to land at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915.\r\rVery soon after the landing, in part due to the high casualty list, he received a number of promotions. Firstly he was made Major with the 13th Battalion, and then Brigade Major of the 15th Infantry Brigade and later the 4th Infantry Brigade. Owing to Burridge being wounded Durrant was given temporary command of the battalion, which he commanded through the heavy fighting around Quinn's Post.\r\rThis action was among the most significant of the Gallipoli engagement, not so much for it\u00d5s strategic success, or failure, but rather because of the courage and heroism of the soldiers caught up in the events around the \u00d4Bloody Angle\u00d5 and \u00d4Baby 700\u00d5. Just how bad this particular spot was can be gauged by the following description by Charles Bean \u00c9 the right flank of that attack brushed past the extreme left of Quinn\u00d5s, which was not itself involved. But the mere strain of holding the post was equivalent to that of a battle. Stray men from the other companies, who had served there, used to speak in awestruck tones of the bombs which the enemy threw. Stories were related of Turkish attacks during which the garrison fired until rifles jammed with the heat and bayonets became twisted. Men passing the fork of Monash Valley, and seeing and hearing the bombs bursting up at Quinn\u00d5s, used to glance at the place (as one of them said) \u00d2as a man looks at a haunted house.\r\rDurrant was compelled to relinquish this position some months later owing to an attack of enteric fever. But even before he was completely recovered he had resumed duties, his knowledge of staff work being utilised as brigade major for the 4th Infantry Brigade, which was then being reorganised. On rejoining his battalion he continued as major till after the evacuation, when he was attached to tho 4th Brigade as Brigade Major.\r\rJames was then amongst the first to proceed to France we he supervised the training of recruits for engagements at both Pozieres and Mouquet Farm. During the fighting Lieutenant-Colonel Durrrant was again given command of his old battalion, and he and his brigade were highly commended by the Divisional Commandant. It was for this action that they were mentioned in dispatches. Durrant\u00d5s only brother (Staff Sergeant E. H. Durrant) also served as a soldier but was refused permission to go to the front. A highly skilled marksman he served on the staff of the School of Musketry in New South Wales. In January 1917 his name was added to the New Years honors list.\r\rBy December 1917, he had been appointed to assistant the Adjutant and Quartermaster-General of the 2nd Army Division. He held this position till shortly after the armistice when he was appointed to the Repatriation and Demobilisation department until December 1919.\r\rIn 1920, Colonel Durrant was appointed assistant Quartermaster-General of the 1st Military District in Queensland, where he held high administrative appointments until 1920, when he was transferred to South Australia as chief administrative officer, A.A. and Q.M.G., of that district. In 1930 he was given the brevet rank of colonel, which was made substantive in July, 1935. Colonel Durrant wasappointed Director of supply transport movements in the Quartermaster-General's branch at Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in January. 1935, and was also appointed A.D.C. to the Governor-General in the same year.", "died_in_service": "", "pds_page_no": "214", "unit_served": "13 Battalion", "surname": "Durrant", "district": "Mcgraths Hill", "service_no": "", "contributor": "201503 GB"}}, {"model": "soldiers.soldier", "pk": 1590, "fields": {"rank": "Lieutenant", "name": "J.", "unique_id": 1590, "date_of_embarkation": null, "desc": "", "died_in_service": "", "pds_page_no": "214", "unit_served": "", "surname": "Meads", "district": "Parramatta", "service_no": "", "contributor": ""}}, {"model": "soldiers.soldier", "pk": 1591, "fields": {"rank": "Private", "name": "Robt.

Dear Mrs. Cawood, - You may have received a notification from the Defence Department that your, daughter, Dorothy, is sick In hospital; so I am writing to tell you not to worry - it's nothing serious - just tonsillitis. I hope to have her back on duty long before this letter reaches you. I want to take this opportunity, Mrs. Cawood, of congratulating you upon having such a good daughter as Dorothy. She is a most excellent nurse - one of the very best Australia has sent out. 'When I told my O.C. that I had sent Dorothy to the Sisters hospital, he said, 'I'm sorry; I like that little girl. She does her work well, and gives no trouble to anyone.' . I will take care of her for you, and not let her work too hard. Kindest regards. Yours sincerely, ETHEL S.

After a stint at the hospital there she moved on to work on the hospital ships between Alexandria and Gallipoli. But the great test of her courage came while on duty In France. In July, 1917, she was under fire at a clearing station when the Germans attacked and killed many of the patients and some hospital Staff. Sister Cawood remained at hor post add afterwards brought In many of the wounded to a place of safety.

We have just left the trenches after some of the hardest fighting In the history of this battalion, and I am sorry to say that we lost two Parramatta boys in the fight, and they were two of the gamest that I have ever seen.

He had great nerve, and proved himself a splendid fighter. We had just attacked and taken the German position, when they opened up terribly heavy artillery fire. Frank bravely went out to carry in a wounded German, and got in quite safely, but it was only about five or ten minutes after that he was killed by a German high explosive shell.
